# Reported, not yet scheduled

Bugs Wyatt reports from daily use **between** live passes. A live-pass checklist covers one release;
this file catches everything else, so a report made mid-batch is not lost to a chat transcript.

The other two lists: [requested-features.md](requested-features.md) for what is owed or asked for, and
[features.md](features.md) for what already works.

**How to use it:** when a batch is being scoped, read this file. When an item ships, delete it from here
and record it in the HANDOFF entry instead — this file is a queue, not a history.

## "The preview does not always respect spaces" — STILL REPRODUCES on v0.35.0

**Wyatt, 2026-07-31, asked directly whether the fix closed it:** *"still see it but lets go over it after
the table changes... it's like it's messing up the formatting of sentences, etc."* So the table-cell fit
fix below was **not** what he was seeing, and "sentences" points away from tables entirely — which makes
the line-per-block model at the bottom of this entry the leading candidate, not the fallback. **Scheduled
for after the table batch**, at his direction. It needs a decision from him, not just a fix: joining
adjacent prose lines into one paragraph is what CommonMark does and is a change to how every markdown
document in the preview looks.

### The earlier investigation, kept in full

**Reported 2026-07-29** with a side-by-side screenshot of the editor and the preview: *"it looks like it's
not respecting the spaces all the time."* **A defect matching that description was found and fixed**
(table columns were fitted at `text_char_width`'s whole-pixel grid cell while the cells were shaped at
the font's real advance, so at the default 16px size every table cell at its natural width broke at its
last space and dropped the last word onto a second line — `md_table_char_w`, `md_table_fit_selftest`).

**Left here because it is not certain that is what he saw.** What was ruled out, with evidence, in case
the report survives the fix:

- **Runs of consecutive spaces do NOT collapse** — the preview draws every space with its own advance
  (verified on rendered pixels: `AAAA    BBBB` keeps its four-space gap). It is *more* literal than
  CommonMark here, not less.
- **Leading indentation is preserved** — an indented paragraph line keeps its spaces, and nested list
  items get their depth from the indent. It is drawn in proportional spaces, so it is visibly *narrower*
  than the same indent in the monospace editor half, which may be what looked wrong.
- **The shaper is not losing spaces** — every space in a block's classified content survives into the
  spans and into the glyph stream (0 drops over the 144 blocks of `research/newtpad-research-report.md`
  plus a 31-block fixture), and `shaped_draw` positions each glyph at the shaper's own `x`, so the draw
  cannot collapse a run either.

**If he still sees it, the remaining candidate is the line-per-block model:** every source line is its own
`.Para` with a full `para_below` gap, so two adjacent prose lines look like two paragraphs and a blank
line between them adds nothing (blank runs are zero height, margins collapse). CommonMark joins those
lines into one paragraph with a space at the break. That is a design question, not a bug — ask before
changing it.
